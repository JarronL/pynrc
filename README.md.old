pyNRC - A JWST NIRCam ETC
=========================

*Authors:* Jarron Leisenring (UA)

**!!Under Development!!**

pyNRC is a set of Python-based tools for planning observations with JWST NIRCam, 
such as an ETC, ~~rudimentary overhead calculator~~ (TBI), simple image slope 
simulator, and full-blown DMS simulator.

The module works for a variety of NIRCam observing modes including direct imaging, 
coronagraphic imaging, slitless grism spectroscopy, ~~DHS observations~~ (TBI), 
and weak lens imaging.
All PSFs are generated via WebbPSF (https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io) to reproduce 
realistic JWST images and spectra.

The documentation is available at https://pynrc.readthedocs.io

**Note**: pyNRC allows for more modes than are officially allowed by the Observatory,
(ie., filter + coronagraphic combinations, subarray sizes, etc.). 
Just because you can do something with pyNRC does not mean it will be supported.
Check out https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/display/JTI/NIRCam+Observing+Modes for more information.

Similar to some of its dependencies, pyNRC requires a host of input data files in
order to generate simulations. Due to the size of these files, they are not included
with this source distribution. Please the documentation for instructions on how to
to download the required data files.
