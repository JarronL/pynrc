def jl_poly(xvals, coeff, dim_reorder=False):
    """Evaluate polynomial
    
    Replacement for np.polynomial.polynomial.polyval(wgood, coeff)
    to evaluate y-values given a set of xvals and coefficients.
    Uses matrix multiplication, which is much faster. Beware, the
    default output array shapes organization may differ from the 
    polyval routine for 2D and 3D results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xvals : ndarray
        1D array (time, for instance)
    coeff : ndarray
        1D, 2D, or 3D array of coefficients from a polynomial fit.
        The first dimension should have a number of elements equal
        to the polynomial degree + 1. Order such that lower degrees
        are first, and higher degrees are last.
    dim_reorder : bool
        Reorder output shape to mimic the polyval routine,
        where the first dimensions correspond to the coeff latter 
        dimensions, and the final dimension is equal to the number 
        of xvals.
                       
    Returns
    -------
    float array
        An array of values where each xval has been evaluated at each
        set of supplied coefficients. The output shape has the first 
        dimension equal to the number of xvals, and the final dimensions
        correspond to coeff's latter dimensions. The result is flattened 
        if there is either only one xval or one set of coeff (or both).

def jl_poly_fit(x, yvals, deg=1, QR=True, robust_fit=False, niter=25):
    """Fast polynomial fitting
    
    Fit a polynomial to a function using linear least-squares.
    This function is particularly useful if you have a data cube
    and want to simultaneously fit a slope to all pixels in order
    to produce a slope image.
    
    Gives the option of performing QR decomposition, which provides
    a considerable speed-up compared to simply using np.linalg.lstsq().
    In addition to being fast, it has better numerical stability than
    linear regressions that involve matrix inversions (ie., dot(x.T,x)).
    
    Returns the coefficients of the fit for each pixel.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        X-values of the data array (1D).
    yvals : ndarray 
        Y-values (1D, 2D, or 3D) where the first dimension
        must have equal length of x. For instance, if x is
        a time series of a data cube with size NZ, then the 
        data cube must follow the Python convention (NZ,NY,NZ).
    deg : int
        Degree of polynomial to fit to the data.
    QR : bool
        Perform QR decomposition? Default=True.
    robust_fit : bool
        Perform robust fitting, iteratively kicking out 
        outliers until convergence.
    niter : int
        Maximum number of iterations for robust fitting.
        If convergence is attained first, iterations will stop.
    
    Example
    -------
    Fit all pixels in a data cube to get slope image in terms of ADU/sec
    
    >>> nz, ny, nx = cube.shape
    >>> tvals = (np.arange(nz) + 1) * 10.737
    >>> coeff = jl_poly_fit(tvals, cube, deg=1)
    >>> bias = coeff[0]  # Bias image (y-intercept)
