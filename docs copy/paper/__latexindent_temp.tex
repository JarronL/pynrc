int objects in high contrast observations is generally limited by our ability to optimally remove the PSF of the host star and minimize residual speckle noise within the halo of the subtracted stellar PSF. Contrast performance of diffraction-limited segmented telescope can be affected by a number of physical factors. \cite{perr18} demonstrate both static and dynamic elements specifical
