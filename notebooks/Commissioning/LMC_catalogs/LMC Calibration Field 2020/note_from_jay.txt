In an email to Martha on 2/16/2021, Jay says:

It's worth warning people that I put together the catalog in
three different finding waves.

The first is the "bright isolated" catalog, which contains stars
that should be able to be measured well and useful for distortion-
solving and PSF-building.  This catalog is provided in:   

     master_output.xymvrdeepmeehuGAIA
     combine_2006p39.xym
     combine_2017p38.xym

There are ~220,000 stars in this catalog, spanning 5' x 5'.

I also supplemented this catalog with stars in the HST images that
were night bright and isolated.  Finally, since HST can't find *all*
the stars that are there, I added some artificial stars based on an
extrapolation of the LF, so that people who want to simulate a
realistic level of crowding and background contamination, they can do
that.  I am imagining that the image simulators are as slow as they've
ever been, so it'll probably be prohibitive for people to simulate
full images with all three waves of finding (isolated, crowded, and
simulated).  I'm guessing most people will be content with the
isolated catalog.  Crowding really shouldn't be a problem for the vast
majority of stars, and the few stars that have crowding issues can be
rejected.
