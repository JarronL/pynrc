#--------------------------------

From Jay's TR-007716 report, sections 10.4 and  10.5:
10.4:
We have a F606W-band magnitude for every real and artificial star. We have J 
and K photometry for the bright real stars and F160W (H) photometry for many 
of the real stars near the center of the field. But many stars do not have 
observed photometry in V, J, H, and K, and we do not have L or M photometry 
for any stars.

In an effort to fill-in these missing values, we used 
color-equation relationships between the observed V, J, H, and K photometry 
for the brighter stars in the young and old populations to fill in J, H, and K 
photometry for the stars that were missing it. 

10.5:
In addition to this empirical 
interpolation, we also used the isochrones to map the J, H, and K colors to 
the fainter stars below the brightness level where we have any actual 
observations. In addition, the isochrones allowed us to extend our photometric 
estimates to the L and M bands as well. These procedures allowed us to come up 
with a comprehensive set of photometry that the JWST instrument teams can use 
to get a true sense of what the LMC scene will look like. 

We provide all this photometry in our “comprehensive” star lists. For each star
in this list, we characterize how it was included with the parameter w. There 
were 213, 353 stars in the isolated bright list; they all have w = 1. There 
were 256, 786 stars found in the deeper finding wave, and they are assigned 
w = 2. Finally, if it is part of our extrapolated effort to estimate the 
crowding at the faint end, then w = 0. The star is artificial. There were 2, 
361, 982 such stars. The total number of stars in the comprehensive list is 
2, 832, 121. Of course, instrument teams do not need to simulate the entire 
scene; they can focus on a small region to get a sense of the crowding that 
they will be dealing with.

Matteo Correnti has add JWST magnitudes in a few bands (F070W, F115W, F150W,
F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W, F490M). These can be found in a catalogue
called "LMC_merged.xlsx", which was shared with Marcia Rieke. Marcia
believes the coordinates come from MASTER.ISO.XYVJHKRD catalogue
From the excel catalogue the following were produced:
LMC_merged.csv (exported from the excel file)
lmc_merged.cat (ascii, contains a fake ID, RA, DEC, F606W, x, y)
LMC_merged.reg (DS9 regions file)
the latter two files were produced using the lmc_read_csv.pl script.

Using the lmc_to_2015p5.pl script an EPOCH 2015.5 catalogue was
created using lmc_merged.cat (derived from Matteo's catalogue)
and  using lmc_to_2015p5.pl  another catalogue was created 
from  master_output.xymvrdeepmeehuGAIA correcting for proper motions.
The match was done in 2 runs - thi first to measure average 
offsets, followed by the mathing itself:

The regions files show

master_merged_nomatch2.reg   unmatched objects in the master catalogue

These can be displayed on ds9 using:
LMC_JWSTCAL_2017.fits

Most of non-matching master sources lie outside the area covered
by lmc_merged.cat.

With the list of matching objects in hand, merge the the master 
and Matteo's catalogue ("photometry") to produce:

master_with_jwst_photometry.catls.gz

This contains almost all data in the master (the GAIA matches
were not included) and positions and magnitudes from the photometry
catalogue.

The merged catalogue will contain J2000.0 coordinates (ra, dec) of 
all stars as measured in 2015.5 (the epoch of GAIA DR2 positions);
the original photometry coordinates (ra_m, dec_m, x_m, y_m) 
are also included.

A version of this catalogue appropriate for guitarra is also produced:

lmc_gaia_guitarra.cat
with its corresponding regions file:
lmc_gaia_guitarra.reg





#--------------------------------------------------------------------

As a double check on the master subcatalogue I also matched against 
GAIA-EDR3; there are small offsets, but not worth the effort of making
any changes:
